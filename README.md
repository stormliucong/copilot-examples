# copilot-examples
A learning repo to try github copilot in vscode

# A few thoughts
- It does not really helpful in creating README.md
- It takes a while for copilot to generate code snipshots
- It is good to start with ''' to indicate what to generate
- It is very useful to fill the tedious work like print()
- It is extremely efficient to generate repeat codes (like in flask-example.py)
- It is helpful in generating testing codes



# How to use

Open the project in vscode and use the copilot command
